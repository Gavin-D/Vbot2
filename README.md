# <i> Setup </i>
Just select the Deathmatch mode in your lobby. It will handle queueing and stuff so <b> dont </b> do anything else.

# <i> "Midnight Mode" </i>
This will increase the estimated time needed to queue for a game. Its not <b> just </b> for midnight, just any time that youd imagine the queue to be longer than normal. It also is a safer but less efficient route if you dont need tons of xp quick.

# <i> How to cancel it </i>
When youre done with it, just alt+tab out and press the X. It <b> will </b> still be giving inputs, so be careful and do it quick.

# <i> Stats </i>
The safest way to do it without breaking anything takes 8-12 minutes. If you run this for at least 8 hours every day (just the time you sleep) before the battlepass ends (16 days from today, the 26th, youll get a total of 320,000 to 480,000 xp ONLY from this.
